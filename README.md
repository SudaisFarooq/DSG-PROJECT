# DSG-PROJECT
STOCK MARKET MOVEMENT PREDICTOR
# Stock Market Predictor


This project aims to predict stock prices using two primary methods: **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** for modeling the stock price movement and **Linear Regression** for making future predictions based on historical data.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a model that can forecast future stock prices by leveraging GBM for stochastic modeling and Linear Regression for trend analysis. The model can be extended to predict multiple stocks and incorporate more complex financial indicators.

## Features
- Predicts future stock prices based on historical data.
- Implements Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) for simulating price paths.
- Uses Linear Regression to predict future values based on trends.

## Requirements

Before running this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- yfinance (for fetching stock data)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib sklearn yfinance
